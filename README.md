# Pokemon Data Overview

Student 1: Bojan Calic  
Student 2: Dusan Misic

**Short description:**

The story behind our idea is to show the evolution concerning specific attributes of the pokemon and generations. Every generation consists of new different pokemons. It is interesting to show and to compare on the one hand the pokemons directly and on the other hand the generations with each other.

## Comments
For this project we used plain Vanilla JavaScript. Original data came from https://pokeapi.co/, which we converted into a single JSON-File with the necessary data for our App. We used additional data from the CSV (https://gist.github.com/armgilles/194bcff35001e7eb53a2a8b441e8b2c6) which simplified the access to some more detailed data.
